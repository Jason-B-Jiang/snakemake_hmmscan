Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> Peptidase_C5  Adenovirus endoprotease
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> Peptidase_C48  Ulp1 protease family, C-terminal catalytic domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
