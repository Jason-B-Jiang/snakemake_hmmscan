Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> ADAM_CR_3  ADAM cysteine-rich domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> Opiods_neuropep  Vertebrate endogenous opioids neuropeptide
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
