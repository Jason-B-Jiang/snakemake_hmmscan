Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> zf-RING_5  zinc-RING finger domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> zf-C3HC4  Zinc finger, C3HC4 type (RING finger)
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
