Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> zf-C2H2_4  C2H2-type zinc finger
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> zf-C2H2_jaz  Zinc-finger double-stranded RNA-binding
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
