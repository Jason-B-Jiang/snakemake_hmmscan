Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> zf-C2H2_4  C2H2-type zinc finger
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> zf-Di19  Drought induced 19 protein (Di19), zinc-binding
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
