Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> LRR_4  Leucine Rich repeats (2 copies)
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> LRR_8  Leucine rich repeat
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> LRR_6  Leucine Rich repeat
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
