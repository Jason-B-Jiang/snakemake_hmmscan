Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> MTS  Methyltransferase small domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> PrmA  Ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase (PrmA)
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
