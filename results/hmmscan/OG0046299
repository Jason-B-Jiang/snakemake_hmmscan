Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> AAA  ATPase family associated with various cellular activities (AAA)
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> AAA_lid_3  AAA+ lid domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
