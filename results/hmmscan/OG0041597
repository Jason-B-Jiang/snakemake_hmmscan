Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> RicinB_lectin_2  Ricin-type beta-trefoil lectin domain-like
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> Ricin_B_lectin  Ricin-type beta-trefoil lectin domain
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
