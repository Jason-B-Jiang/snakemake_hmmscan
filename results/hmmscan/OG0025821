Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> zf-C2H2  Zinc finger, C2H2 type
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> zf-C2H2_jaz  Zinc-finger double-stranded RNA-binding
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
