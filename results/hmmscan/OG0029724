Domain annotation for each model (and alignments):
>> TPR_2  Tetratricopeptide repeat
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]

>> TPR_8  Tetratricopeptide repeat
   [No individual domains that satisfy reporting thresholds (although complete target did)]
